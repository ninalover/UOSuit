UO Endless suit calculator is a console based application written in C#.
Can be compiled with .net core 2.0 under both linux and windows, i don't have access to a Mac, so can't test it there.
UO Endless suit calculator is an application for use when you create suits for you're favorite toons.
It does lack an exit function, but you can press ctrl+c to get back to the console.
For commands press F1, to move around use cursor keys, home, end,pageUp/Down
When i get the time i might clean up the code, there is alot of redundant code in it, i created this application in a week or so.
Features i might add in the future is XML based save/load, and maby a dialog for saving/loading parts or whole suits.
Anyways have fun with the calculator
